# EECSlab05
Lab 5 from EECS 268 from year 2021:

The concept of this lab is to get familiar with reading from a file as well as
handling multiple files. In this lab, there will be a sample input file (inputfile.txt) 
which shows dimensions of a text map at the top as well as the starting location. 

The map that is comprised of symbols. '#' represents a wall, 'S' represents sewers 
through which the 'person' can move. The objective is to find the shortest path 
through the map if you start at a given location in the input file.
